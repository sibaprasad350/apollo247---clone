# apollo247---clone
The Apollo247 Clone is a web application that mimics the General Physician/Internal Medicine page from Apollo247. It enables users to view a list of doctors, apply filters for searching doctors, and view doctor details such as specialty, location, and rating.

A clone of the [Apollo247 General Physician/Internal Medicine page](https://www.apollo247.com/specialties/general-physician-internal-medicine), featuring doctor listings with filtering and pagination. Built using Next.js for the frontend and Node.js with MongoDB for the backend.
